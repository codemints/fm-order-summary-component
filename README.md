# Simple Order Summary Component
Frontend Masters Order Summary Component Project

## Technologies & Principals
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

This is a project I created using plain HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS (only a couple lines to deal with margin on an element for mobile). I typically build components inside of a larger design framework, so a few of the naming conventions and methodologies are a bit strange for a project this small.

I am also moving from a BEM mind state into CUBE, so I've got a little mix of both in there. As a result of my relatively new level of familiarity with the principles, some of the code should be reworked and cleaned up, but overall I'm happy with the project.
